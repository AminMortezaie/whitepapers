# Helium (HNT)

A decenterlized wireless network

# What's helium network?

The Helium network is a decentralized wireless network
that enables devices anywhere in the world to wirelessly
connect to the Internet and geolocate themselves without
the need for power-hungry satellite location hardware or
expensive cellular plans.

# Incentivizing A Two Sided Marketplace

Powering the Helium network is
a blockchain with a native protocol token incentivizing a two-sided marketplace between coverage providers and coverage
consumers.

# Injecting Decentralization

With the introduction of a blockchain, we inject
decentralization into an industry currently controlled by
monopolies. The result is that wireless network coverage
becomes a commodity, fueled by competition, available
anywhere in the world, at a fraction of current costs.

# Helium Network Key Components

**<li>Proof-of-Coverage** <br/>
We present a computationally inexpensive Proof-of-Coverage that allows Miners to prove they
are providing wireless network coverage.</li>

**<li>Helium Network** <br/>
We demonstrate an entirely new purpose built blockchain network built to service WHIP and provide a system for authenticating and identifying devices,
providing cryptographic guarantees of data transmission
and authenticity, offer transaction primitives designed
around WHIP, and more.</li>

**<li>Helium Consensus Protocol** <br/>
We present a novel consensus
protocol construction that creates a permissionless, high
throughput, censor-resistant system by combining an asynchronous byzantine fault tolerant protocol with identities
presented via Proof-of-Coverage.</li>

**<li>WHIP** <br/>
We introduce a new open-source and standards compliant wireless network protocol, called WHIP, designed for low power Devices over vast areas.</li>

**<li>Proof-of-Location** <br/>
We outline a system for interpreting the
physical geolocation of a Device using WHIP without the
need for expensive and power-hungry satellite location
hardware. Devices can make immutable, secure, and
verifiable claims about their location at a given moment
in time which is recorded in the blockchain.

</li>

**<li>DWN** <br/>
We present a decentralized wireless network (DWN)
that provides wireless access to the Internet for Devices
by way of multiple independent Miners and outlines the
Helium network and WHIP specification by which participants in the Helium network should conform. Routers
pay this network of Miners for sending data to and from
the Internet, and Miners are rewarded with newly-minted
tokens for providing network coverage and delivering Device data to the Internet.
