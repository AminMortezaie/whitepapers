# Owning A Property
To own a property, you need specific real property documents to support your rights to the property. Real property includes any structures on the land, any person’s rights and interests related to the property, and natural parts of the land. As a property owner, it is important to understand what documents you need to verify your ownership.

# Proof of Ownership
Proof of ownership is how you claim the rights to a certain property.<br/>
In the late 1800s, proof of ownership expanded from a local matter to a national one, when the federal government created specific regulations for the process. By making it national, the process became simpler, and gave property owners an easy way to prove their rights.

# How does it work in Cryptocurrencies?
This has been a challenge facing Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and other digital assets created with the blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies.<br/>

With Public Key cryptography, which is used in Blockchains and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT), the ownership of the assets is directly linked to the correspondent Private Key. In order to prove ownership of these crypto currencies you need to prove that you know the respective Private Key.<br/>

However, revealing the Private Key itself would be inappropriate due to a number of reasons. The most critical being that you compromise the security of your crypto currencies **(The counterparty knowing your Private Key can do everything with your crypto currencies)**.Therefore, it doesn’t make sense to share the Private Key directly in order to prove ownership.

# Three Ways to Prove Ownership of Your Crypto Assets

**<li> Transferring a Small Amount of Cryptocurrency<br/>**

Some companies prove ownership by transferring a small amount from the respective address to the address of the third-party that wants to check ownership. However, also this method is prone to fraud and not reliable at all. For example, I could instruct a crypto exchange to transfer some amount to a third-party address. If that crypto exchange transfers this amount from an omnibus wallet the third-party could wrongly assume that I have ownership of all the funds on the respective address although I obviously don’t have.</li>

**<li>Generate a Statement from a Cryptocurrency Account<br/>**

Generating a statement from your cryptocurrency account, exchange or wallet, ideally showing your name, the amount of your holdings, the valuation of your crypto assets in USD, the date(s) of purchase and other information, could also be used to prove your ownership of crypto assets. You could also provide a screenshot. This could be suitable if the other party is familiar with and trusts the security of the digital wallet used.</li>


**<li>Sign a Message with Your Private Key<br/>** 

>The most reliable way to prove ownership of crypto currencies is to sign a specified message with your Private Key. By doing so, the third-party can verify that the counterparty really knows the respective Private Key without the need of revealing the very key or having to send a transaction.<br/>

The message can be as simple as, “I own this address,” a show of the public address, and the provision  of a valid signature, which essentially proves ownership.

# Bearer *[berer]* Assets and Proving Ownership
A bearer asset, instrument or security is one in which no ownership information is recorded and the asset is issued in physical form to the individual who purchases it. The holder of a bearer instrument is the owner and whoever is in possession of the document or certificate authorizing ownership is the rightful owner.<br/>

Issuers of a bearer asset keep no record of ownership. This means that that asset is traded without a formal record or system demonstrating ownership. Ownership is transferred by simply transferring the document or certificate from one individual to another. Further, there is no requirement for reporting the transfer.
