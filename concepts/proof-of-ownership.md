# Blockchain: Proof of Ownership Explained
Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology with novel features, including decentralization, cryptographic security, and immutability. Accordingly, every transaction that occurs on a blockchain remains unalterable and unmodifiable.<br/>

In addition, blockchain offers mathematically verifiable digital scarcity of assets. Further, blockchain offers proof of ownership with each transactional movement of an asset by its very nature.<br/>

However, many different businesses are introducing blockchain proof of ownership using non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In turn, this presents a new opportunity for consumers to take digital ownership to the next level.


# Owning A Property
To own a property, you need specific real property documents to support your rights to the property. Real property includes any structures on the land, any person’s rights and interests related to the property, and natural parts of the land. As a property owner, it is important to understand what documents you need to verify your ownership.

# Proof of Ownership
Proof of ownership is how you claim the rights to a certain property.<br/>
In the late 1800s, proof of ownership expanded from a local matter to a national one, when the federal government created specific regulations for the process. By making it national, the process became simpler, and gave property owners an easy way to prove their rights.

# What is Blockchain Proof of Ownership?
The ability for blockchain proof of ownership across a range of different assets is essentially thanks to the introduction of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). <br/>

>“Yeah, I heard about NFTs; they’re basically like fancy JPEGs, aren’t they?” – well, no. Not really. <br/>

Unlike fungible cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) represent unique pieces of data on the blockchain. Users can buy, trade, and invest in NFTs as assets rather than using them as a medium of exchange. Also, unlike cryptocurrencies that are divisible into smaller units, NFTs are whole assets sold in a single transaction **(there are, however, some exceptions with fractional ownership NFTs that we will need them!)**.

The beauty in NFTs is the blockchain **proof of ownership**, or **proof of authenticity**, with cryptographic backing and provable digital scarcity. <br/>

NFT standards allow for the tokenization of just about anything on the blockchain. Plus, each piece of data on the blockchain becomes immutable upon entry. This means that other users cannot alter or adjust any data already present on the chain. In turn, this presents a cryptographic blockchain proof of ownership or authenticity of data, with mathematical verification of the validity of NFT transactions.    

# How does it work in Cryptocurrencies?
This has been a challenge facing Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and other digital assets created with the blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies.<br/>

With Public Key cryptography, which is used in Blockchains and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT), the ownership of the assets is directly linked to the correspondent Private Key. In order to prove ownership of these crypto currencies you need to prove that you know the respective Private Key.<br/>

However, revealing the Private Key itself would be inappropriate due to a number of reasons. The most critical being that you compromise the security of your crypto currencies **(The counterparty knowing your Private Key can do everything with your crypto currencies)**.Therefore, it doesn’t make sense to share the Private Key directly in order to prove ownership.

# Three Ways to Prove Ownership of Your Crypto Assets

**<li> Transferring a Small Amount of Cryptocurrency<br/>**

Some companies prove ownership by transferring a small amount from the respective address to the address of the third-party that wants to check ownership. However, also this method is prone to fraud and not reliable at all. For example, I could instruct a crypto exchange to transfer some amount to a third-party address. If that crypto exchange transfers this amount from an omnibus wallet the third-party could wrongly assume that I have ownership of all the funds on the respective address although I obviously don’t have.</li>

**<li>Generate a Statement from a Cryptocurrency Account<br/>**

Generating a statement from your cryptocurrency account, exchange or wallet, ideally showing your name, the amount of your holdings, the valuation of your crypto assets in USD, the date(s) of purchase and other information, could also be used to prove your ownership of crypto assets. You could also provide a screenshot. This could be suitable if the other party is familiar with and trusts the security of the digital wallet used.</li>


**<li>Sign a Message with Your Private Key<br/>** 

>The most reliable way to prove ownership of crypto currencies is to sign a specified message with your Private Key. By doing so, the third-party can verify that the counterparty really knows the respective Private Key without the need of revealing the very key or having to send a transaction.<br/>

The message can be as simple as, “I own this address,” a show of the public address, and the provision  of a valid signature, which essentially proves ownership.
 </li>

# Bearer *[berer]* Assets and Proving Ownership
A bearer asset, instrument or security is one in which no ownership information is recorded and the asset is issued in physical form to the individual who purchases it. The holder of a bearer instrument is the owner and whoever is in possession of the document or certificate authorizing ownership is the rightful owner.<br/>

Issuers of a bearer asset keep no record of ownership. This means that that asset is traded without a formal record or system demonstrating ownership. Ownership is transferred by simply transferring the document or certificate from one individual to another. Further, there is no requirement for reporting the transfer.<br/>

A discussion of bearer instruments or assets is applicable when evaluating the security of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because cryptocurrency is a bearer asset: Whoever holds the private key is considered the owner.<br/>

The blockchain enables self-custody of digital assets: the owner of crypto assets is free to choose from various wallet solutions, and the regulatory environment continues to shift. In some ways, every digital asset owner needs to become their own custodian, which can be frustrating when considering the security of those assets.<br/>

>This can make it extremely hard to demonstrate proof of ownership should a private key be stolen or lost. This security and custody issue is perhaps one of the biggest reasons why institutional players have been slow to accept cryptocurrency. 

# Features of Blockchain Technology 
The proof of authenticity and digital ownership is securely transparent, displaying cryptographic hashes representing users’ wallet addresses. These are known as public keys. Only people who have access to the corresponding private keys can access the hashed data, making blockchain one of the most secure data-sharing technologies. <br/>

Further to the publicly transparent digital ownership, blockchain technology offers mathematically verifiable digital scarcity of an asset. Scarcity is a key value proposition for any currency or deflationary asset. In a free market, the scarcity (supply) and demand for an asset determine its value. Blockchain offers reliable, accurate, and trustless records of verifiable digital scarcity of an asset.<br/>

>Also, blockchain is a permissionless, borderless, and censorship-resistant technology operating through a global network of computers called nodes. This means that anyone can take advantage of blockchain proof of ownership regardless of age, creed, status, or location. 

# Industries using Blockchain Proof of Ownership

## **Real Estate<br/>**
Proof of ownership on the blockchain will eventually remove the need for realtors or estate agents. This is because all necessary information is immutably stored on the blockchain. With this cutting-edge technology, people can tokenize their houses as NFTs on the blockchain. As such, a peer-to-peer housing market is likely to emerge as digital ownership evolves with next-level technologies.<br/>

Blockchain technology presents a novel opportunity for more accessible real estate purchases abroad. Also, first-time buyers could opt for property overseas without the stress and hassle of realtors or lawyers.<br/>

Smart contracts can generate a decentralized escrow account that can only transfer ownership of land deeds upon receiving the total amount requested. Plus, introducing blockchain proof of ownership in the real estate industry makes it easier if one was to give or sell their house to a close relative or friend. 
</li>

## **Supply Chain Management <br/>**
The supply chain management industry covers a variety of sectors within the work line. Also, supply chains are found across a range of different industries. The advantages of blockchain integration are apparent even from the beginning of the supply chain, offering blockchain proof of ownership of raw materials. This adds an extra layer of quality control right from the beginning of the work line. 
**<li> Food <br/>**
In the food industry, blockchain and internet of things (IoT) devices can provide reliable temperature control of food in transit. Plus, smart contracts can determine the inventory management of goods monitoring the “use by” and “sell by” dates and origin of food. Also, blockchain could offer transparent digital ownership of veg or meat farms for end consumers through QR codes.</li>

**<li> Healthcare <br/>**
In the future, the healthcare industry could offer medical records with blockchain proof of ownership. Patients could create and have true digital ownership of their medical history as a non-fungible token (NFT). As such, general practitioners (GPs), specialists, and surgeons could receive secure private keys to access the data. As a result, communication and efficiency between staff, departments, and hospitals will drastically increase.</li>


**<li>Customer Service<br/>**
The customer service industry could potentially indirectly benefit from cryptographic digital ownership. The increase in access and communications efficiency of multiple databases due to the blockchain proof of ownership throughout the supply chain makes it far easier to resolve customer concerns. Plus, customer service staff could have seamless, interoperable *[iner Aaper able]*, and secure access to various databases throughout the supply chain.
