# The Blockchain Trilemma
Decentralized, Scalable, and Secure?<br/>

Termed by Vitalik Buterin, The Blockchain Trilemma addresses the challenges developers face in creating a blockchain that is scalable, decentralized and secure — without compromising on any facet.

# Blockchain's trade-offs
**Decentralized**<br/>
creating a blockchain system that does not rely on a central point of control<br/>
**Scalable**<br/> the ability for a blockchain system to handle an increasingly growing amount of transactions<br/>
**Secure**<br/>
the ability of the blockchain system to operate as expected, defend itself from attacks, bugs, and other unforeseen issues

# The trade-off of pure decentralization 

The trade-off of pure decentralization, however, is speed. If a transaction requires multiple confirmations before reaching consensus, then inherently, it would take longer than if a transaction can be confirmed by a single entity. Bitcoin is known to be robustly decentralized, but at the same time, pretty slow.

# EOS is so centerlized

Let’s use EOS, a blockchain project focused on scalability, as an example. Currently, the current maximum throughput of EOS is claimed to be around 4,000 TPS, or transactions per second. More importantly, the EOS whitepaper describes the track for EOS to process millions of transactions per second in the future.<br/>

Comparatively, Visa handles an average of 63,000 TPS. If EOS can fulfill its promise of scalability, it can create a network superior to a major international credit service. Not bad!<br/>

But, as the trilemma suggests, there is a trade-off. EOS serves as an example of what a focus on scalability may offer, but it has received criticism for being too centralized.<br/>
