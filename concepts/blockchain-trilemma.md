# The Blockchain Trilemma *[Trylema]*
Decentralized, Scalable, and Secure?<br/>

Termed by Vitalik Buterin, The Blockchain Trilemma addresses the challenges developers face in creating a blockchain that is scalable, decentralized and secure — without compromising on any facet.

# Blockchain's trade-offs
**Decentralized**<br/>
creating a blockchain system that does not rely on a central point of control<br/>
**Scalable**<br/> the ability for a blockchain system to handle an increasingly growing amount of transactions<br/>
**Secure**<br/>
the ability of the blockchain system to operate as expected, defend itself from attacks, bugs, and other unforeseen issues

# The trade-off of pure decentralization 

The trade-off of pure decentralization, however, is speed. If a transaction requires multiple confirmations before reaching consensus, then inherently, it would take longer than if a transaction can be confirmed by a single entity. Bitcoin is known to be robustly decentralized, but at the same time, pretty slow.

# EOS is so centerlized but fast

Let’s use EOS, a blockchain project focused on scalability, as an example. Currently, the current maximum throughput of EOS is claimed to be around 4,000 TPS, or transactions per second. More importantly, the EOS whitepaper describes the track for EOS to process millions of transactions per second in the future.<br/>

Comparatively, Visa handles an average of 63,000 TPS. If EOS can fulfill its promise of scalability, it can create a network superior to a major international credit service. Not bad!<br/>

But, as the trilemma suggests, there is a trade-off. EOS serves as an example of what a focus on scalability may offer, but it has received criticism for being too centralized.<br/>

# Many crypto projects had chosen to focus on decentralization and scalability, leaving security behind

With a barrage of high-profile hacks of exchanges and manipulated vulnerabilities in source code, it’s evident that many crypto projects had chosen to focus on decentralization and scalability, leaving security behind.<br/>

Due to the transparent nature of the source code and the potentially lucrative benefits one can receive from conducting a successful attack, blockchains have become prime targets for hackers.<br/>

# Is It Really Actually a Trilemma?

Firstly, it’s important to note that the Trilemma is just a model to conceptualize the various challenges facing blockchain technology. There is no law stating that the 3 aspects cannot be achieved. But to date, teams have worked on different approaches in an attempt to maximize decentralization, scalability, and security.<br/>

The CertiK Foundation believes that the Trilemma may actually be better conceptualized in a pyramid. The base layer is the fundamental layer that upholds all others: security. Without it, decentralization may be corrupted and scalability may be short-lived. 

# Final Result

Regardless of the shape of the Trilemma, it’s agreed that it’s difficult for any blockchain system to effectively achieve decentralization, scalability, and security. Blockchain technology is in its infancy, and the technology approaches should only improve. The CertiK Chain is unique in its prioritization of security above all else; by establishing a strong fundamental layer, the possibilities are endless
