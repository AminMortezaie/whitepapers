# Parachain
A parachain is an application-specific data structure that is globally coherent and validatable by the validators of the Relay Chain.
Parachains are custom, project-specific blockchains that are integrated within the Polkadot (DOT) and Kusama (KSM) networks.<br/>

They take their name from the concept of parallelized chains that run parallel to the Relay Chain. Most commonly, a parachain will take the form of a blockchain, but there is no specific need for them to be actual blockchains.

# How Parachain Work
Polkadot and Kusama are networks that allow both information and tokens to be transferred on them. Unlike Ethereum, where decentralized applications are created within the bounds set by its blockchain, Polkadot and Kusama allow developers to create their own independent blockchains.

This means that each parachain can have its own parameters such as block times, transaction fees, governance mechanism and mining rewards.

Parachains benefit from the Polkadot and Kusama networkâ€™s security, maintained by the Relay Chain, rather than having to rely on their own set of validator nodes. Instead, parachains are maintained by collator nodes that store a full history for each parachain and aggregate parachain transaction data into blocks to be added to the Relay Chain. 

# Parachain Auctions
Polkadot and Kusama are expected to only support up to 100 parachains slots on their networks, a number that is flexible and subject to change. <br/>

Each parachain has a dedicated parachain slot to attach to the Relay Chain, and, in order to gain access to one of the slots, Web3, the team behind Polkadot and Kusama, has created what they call Parachain Auctions as a method to distribute the available slots in an equitable manner.  
<br/>
Parachain auction participants have a determined amount of time to place bids on the projects they wish to see get a parachain slot, and the project that garnered the most support at a randomly determined time during the bidding process will generally obtain the ability to use a parachain slot.
