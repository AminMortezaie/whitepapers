# Brand-New Blockchain Phenomenon
Few people believed in Bitcoin's success in 2009. In 2021, many people deeply regret not buying a few Bitcoins when the price had not yet sky-rocketed. Now, we witness another blockchain phenomenon that is about to transform the way we own and trade real things - **asset tokenization**.


# What's Asset Tokenization?
Blockchain will tend to the financial landscape and enable an asset to be easily broken down into smaller units, representing ownership, encouraging the democratization of investment in historically illiquid assets and bring about fairer markets. Whether it be paintings, digital media platforms, real-estate property, company shares, or collectibles, everything can be tokenized on a distributed ledger. This leads us to the question: What is asset tokenization?<br/>

Asset tokenization is the process by which an issuer creates digital tokens on a distributed ledger or blockchain, which represent either digital or physical assets. Blockchain guarantees that once you buy tokens representing an asset, no single authority can erase or change your ownership — your ownership of that asset remains entirely immutable.<br/>

One asset is not generally equal to one token: assets are usually broken down into smaller parts, which form many tokens. Once the owner has tokenized their assets and they have entered the digital world, it becomes possible to store and trade them fractionally or completely, as well as transfer them to other owners.

# What does STO stand for?
Those who have heard about asset tokenization or searched for the term on Google before may have heard something about STO as well. Indeed, STO (short for Security Token Offering), has a lot to do with blockchain technology and tokenization.

# How is Asset Tokenization Process?
Everything starts with blockchain – the technology makes it possible to create and store tokens. Then an asset owner needs to choose a special STO platform that enables them to digitize their assets and turn them into the number of tokens they need. After that, they can launch their own STO campaign, and anyone in the world can buy those tokens, thereby investing in the asset holder’s business.

# Asset Tokenization is Expanding Fast
In recent years, more and more asset owners, startups, and investors are discovering tokenization opportunities. As the popularity of asset tokenization grows, so does the size of this market. According to **Plutoneo**, for example, in Europe alone, the size of the tokenized asset market is projected at €1.4 trillion in 2024.<br/>

>Asset tokenization is obviously about to become the next global trend. Just like Bitcoin, which changed the financial world in the 2010s and made cryptocurrencies the new norm, asset tokenization has the potential to be a new transformative force in the 2020s.

# An Example For Asset Tokenization
Suppose you have a property worth $500,000 in New York, NY. Asset tokenization could convert ownership of this property into 500,000 tokens — each one representing a tiny percentage (0.0002%) of the property. Let's say you need to borrow $50,000; it wouldn’t make sense to sell your property, because you need somewhere to live, but you still need the money. So instead, you issue tokens on a public distributed ledger like Hedera Hashgraph which allows people to freely buy and sell on different exchanges. When someone buys a token, they buy 0.0002% of the ownership in the asset. 500,000 tokens to become 100% owner of the property. Since distributed ledger technologies are immutable, no one can erase the ownership of the investor who has bought the tokens, or in this matter, shares of a property.

# Types Of Asset Tokenization
There are two types of asset tokenization as following:
<li>Fungible asset tokenization<br/></li>
<li>Non-fungible asset tokenization</li><br/>

# Fungible Asset Tokenization
**<li>Interchangeable:**  Each unit of the tokenized asset has the same market value and validity — for example, Bitcoin: All units of 1 $BTC are exactly the same. They hold the same market value, and are interchangeable. It doesn't matter from whom a $BTC was purchased, since all BTC units have the same functionality and are part of the same network. You can swap one-fourth of a $BTC for anyone else's one-fourth of a $BTC, with confidence that your $BTC’s one-fourth holds the same value, despite being one-fourth of different coins.
</li>

**<li>Divisible:** A fungible cryptocurrency can be divided into as many decimal places which were configured during its issuance. Each unit will have the same value and validity.
</li>

# Non-Fungible Asset Tokenization (NFT)
**<li>Non-interchangeable:** NFTs can't be replaced with tokens of the same type because each token represents a unique value.</li>
**<li>Non-divisible:** NFTs are not typically divisible, although F-NFTs do offer fractional ownership of NFTs, such as in the case of expensive fine art or commercial real-estate.</li>
**<li>Unique:** Each token differs from another token of the same type and has unique information and attributes.</li>

# What can be Tokenized?
The possibilities are endless as tokenization allows for both fractional ownership and proof-of-ownership. From traditional assets like venture capital funds, bonds, commodities, and real-estate properties to exotic assets like sports teams, race horses, artwork, and celebrities, companies worldwide use blockchain technology to tokenize almost anything. However, we have grouped them into four main categories:

**<li>Asset:** An asset is any item of value that someone can transform into cash. It’s further divided into two classes: **personal and business.** Personal assets can include cashand property. Business assets include assets that are present on the balance sheet.</li>

**<li>Equity:** Equity (shares) can be tokenized; however, the assets remain in the digital form of security tokens stored online in a wallet. Investors can typically buy shares on a stock exchange.</li>

**<li>Funds:** An investment fund is a type of asset that investors can tokenize — these tokens represent an investors' share of the fund. Each investor is provided tokens which represent their share of the fund.</li>

**<li>Services:** A business can offer goods or services as a way to raise funds or conduct business. Investors can use tokens to purchase goods or services provided by the supplier.
</li>

# Benefits of Asset Tokenization From An Asset Owner’s Perspective

**<li>Greater accessibility and liquidity of assets<br/>**
Blockchain technology provides a decentralized system and allows anyone from anywhere in the world to tokenize their assets and sell them at any time. Moreover, the list of assets can be extremely broad and it even includes rather illiquid assets such as real estate, antiques, artworks, private company interests, cars, etc. Blockchain thus removes numerous barriers to investment and provides greater liquidity.<br/>

Let’s use the example of an individual requiring $50,000 taken out of a condo valued at $500,000. This individual may have tokenized their condo into 500,000 security tokens, each worth 0.0002%. They might sell 50,000 tokens, instead of selling the entire property and losing its utility as a livable space, thus ensuring a more liquid asset.
</li>

**<li>Fair prices**
<br/>
Tokenization of assets would increase an asset's liquidity, as it facilitates fractional ownership, which eliminates illiquidity discounts. Moreover, selling small fractions of ownership enables owners to charge a fair market price.</li>

**<li>Reduced management costs**
<br/>
If you transfer ownership of an asset today, it requires lawyers acting as intermediaries to handle the paperwork and create trust between you and a buyer — this results in extra time and cost. If you choose to tokenize the very same asset and utilize a decentralized platform or marketplace it’ll automate many parts of this process, saving time and cost.
</li>

# Benefits of Asset Tokenization From An Investor’s Perspective
**<li> Increased liquidity**<br/>
Considering the example above of a tokenized property, it’s now possible for retail investors to invest smaller amounts of money in a property. Investors have a chance to diversify their portfolio by investing, for example, a sum of $10,000 — this wasn’t historically possible without a lot of paperwork, which costs money and takes extra time. Investors benefit from the increased liquidity of assets through tokenization.
</li>

**<li> Shorter lock-up periods**<br/>
Lock-up periods restrict investors from selling their assets. Sometimes this is due to the asset being large and illiquid. Tokenization of assets has the potential to shorten the lock-period, due to investors being able to sell their tokens easily in a liquid market. Investors, in this scenario, no longer have to wait for years to take profits or losses.
</li>

**<li>Transparent process**<br/>
Since the underlying technology behind asset tokenization, blockchain, is **immutable**, owners are unable to change an assets' history to make it appear more attractive. This allows investors to see the history of a holding and make more informed decisions.Anyone interested in creating, selling, or buying tokens can rest assured that the asset information and transaction records are accurate, as they are verified and cannot be changed once recorded onto the blockchain.
</li>

**<li>Secure identity**<br/>
With ownership and decentralized identity (DID) details kept on the blockchain, a buyers' private-public key pair forms a digital signature ensuring it’s really them — this can be used for things like KYC / AML verification. Additionally, there are DID identifiers decided upon by standards organization, such as w3c, ensuring acceptance across many different networks and platforms.
</li>

# The importance of Tokenization in the Real Estate industry
The tokenization of real estate assets can play a significant role in the real estate industry. The notary visit, the considerable transaction costs or the land transfer tax become technically obsolete through the use of tokenization.**The result is an increase in efficiency through corresponding financial and time savings.** In short, "tokens" are positioned on the same level as conventional securities. They benefit from the above-mentioned potential increases.


# Risks and Challenges Associated with Asset Tokenization
Despite the ever-growing interest in blockchain asset tokenization, the world is still being slow to adapt to this phenomenon. Let’s consider in more detail what challenges and barriers stand in the way of tokenization and how they can be overcome in the future.

## Regulatory issues
Most of the obstacles are related to regulatory issues and current technology constraints. At the same time, countries haven’t yet developed common regulations that would apply in different jurisdictions.<br/>

However, this is a completely normal situation faced by any new technology or global trend, and there is always a way out. Politicians, regulators, and even developers need to join forces and begin work on defining the legal framework and drafting global laws and regulations regarding tokenized assets and the activities associated with them.

## Not Immune from Attacks
Like any other technology, blockchain is unfortunately often targeted by hackers. For example, during 2020, hackers launched 122 cyberattacks and stole $3.78 billion.It is estimated that by 2025 $10.5 trillion will be spent to prevent and fight cybercrimes.<br/>

As you can see, all the necessary measures are being taken in order to provide maximum security to blockchain processes. In the meantime, the benefits of blockchain technology and the opportunities offered by asset tokenization are still worth considering and exploiting in the near future.

# The Future of Asset Tokenization
Tokenization is poised to transform asset management as we know it today. It democratizes access to markets while ensuring fairness and security. **The only obstacle today being legal boundaries — to what extent this hurdle stands in the way depends on the type of asset you want to tokenize.** A network for exchanging Basketball cards will have small hurdles compared to a platform of expensive paintings.
