# What's Asset Tokenization?
Blockchain will tend to the financial landscape and enable an asset to be easily broken down into smaller units, representing ownership, encouraging the democratization of investment in historically illiquid assets and bring about fairer markets. Whether it be paintings, digital media platforms, real-estate property, company shares, or collectibles, everything can be tokenized on a distributed ledger. This leads us to the question: What is asset tokenization?<br/>

Asset tokenization is the process by which an issuer creates digital tokens on a distributed ledger or blockchain, which represent either digital or physical assets. Blockchain guarantees that once you buy tokens representing an asset, no single authority can erase or change your ownership — your ownership of that asset remains entirely immutable.

# An Example For Asset Tokenization
Suppose you have a property worth $500,000 in New York, NY. Asset tokenization could convert ownership of this property into 500,000 tokens — each one representing a tiny percentage (0.0002%) of the property. Let's say you need to borrow $50,000; it wouldn’t make sense to sell your property, because you need somewhere to live, but you still need the money. So instead, you issue tokens on a public distributed ledger like Hedera Hashgraph which allows people to freely buy and sell on different exchanges. When someone buys a token, they buy 0.0002% of the ownership in the asset. 500,000 tokens to become 100% owner of the property. Since distributed ledger technologies are immutable, no one can erase the ownership of the investor who has bought the tokens, or in this matter, shares of a property.

# Types Of Asset Tokenization
There are two types of asset tokenization as following:
<li>Fungible asset tokenization<br/></li>
<li>Non-fungible asset tokenization</li><br/>

# Fungible Asset Tokenization
**<li>Interchangeable:**  Each unit of the tokenized asset has the same market value and validity — for example, Bitcoin: All units of 1 $BTC are exactly the same. They hold the same market value, and are interchangeable. It doesn't matter from whom a $BTC was purchased, since all BTC units have the same functionality and are part of the same network. You can swap one-fourth of a $BTC for anyone else's one-fourth of a $BTC, with confidence that your $BTC’s one-fourth holds the same value, despite being one-fourth of different coins.
</li>

**<li>Divisible:** A fungible cryptocurrency can be divided into as many decimal places which were configured during its issuance. Each unit will have the same value and validity.
</li>

# Non-Fungible Asset Tokenization
**<li>Non-interchangeable:** NFTs can't be replaced with tokens of the same type because each token represents a unique value.</li>
**<li>Non-divisible:** NFTs are not typically divisible, although F-NFTs do offer fractional ownership of NFTs, such as in the case of expensive fine art or commercial real-estate.</li>
**<li>Unique:** Each token differs from another token of the same type and has unique information and attributes.</li>
