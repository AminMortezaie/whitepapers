# Centrifuge
Centrifuge is a network that provides access to fast, cheap capital for small businesses and stable yield for investors. Centrifuge bridges real-world assets into DeFi (“Decentralized Finance”) to bring down the cost of capital for small to medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) and provide DeFi investors with a stable source of yield **uncorrelated from volatile crypto assets.**

Tinlake is Centrifuge’s investment app that acts as an open marketplace of real-world asset pools. Investors can look through the pools provided by Asset Originators and invest in the ones that work for them.


# Why Centrifuge and A DeFi Platform?
In today’s financial system, only the largest businesses get direct access to liquid capital markets. Most depend on banks for their capital needs. The lack of an **open and transparent marketplace** denies these smaller businesses access to competitive interest rates mostly due to market inefficiencies and transaction costs.<br/>

DeFi is a growing financial system without any barriers of entry. Centrifuge wants to bring this benefit to all borrowers that until now had no access to DeFi liquidity.
