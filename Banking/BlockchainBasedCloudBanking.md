## A literature review on Blockchain and its applications

Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) are based on three fundamentals: **cryptography (public keys, hash functions), networking (peer-to-peer, etc) and consensus mechanism (game theory).** Its goal is to create **a unified and trusted ledger** which is secure, always available, shared among the involved parties and impossible to control by any single party. In terms of information technology, a **distributed ledger** is simply a **replicated database** of transaction data and some other information (e.g. coin reward, messages).

### Architectures:
Based on architecture, all the implemented DLTs can be classified into three
types: 

   **Blockchain, Tangle and Hashgraph.**
   
While the two laters are complex systems based on the **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** structure, the former is easily understood as its name, a chain of blocks.

* IOTA is the most famous project deployed Tangle since 2017.
*  Hedera is a typical project applied Hashgraph since 2019. 
* Blockchain is the most popular, intensively studied and developed DLT which is original from Bitcoin and proven via many notableprojects, for instances, Ethereum, Ripple, Corda-R3, Azure (Microsoft), Quorum (acquired by Consensys from JP Morgan Chase).

سلیم رمجی (Salim Ramji)، رئیس جهانی بخش ETF ها و سرمایه‌گذاری‌ های شاخص در غول سرمایه‌گذاری BlackRock، در مصاحبه اخیر خود با Financial News مستقر در لندن از بلاک چین تمجید کرد و مدعی شد این فناوری که زیربنای بیت‌کوین و سایر ارزهای دیجیتال است، **«به‌طور باورنکردنی» تحول آفرین و خلاقانه** است.

این مدیر ارشد بر پتانسیل بلاک چین برای افزایش کارایی بازارهای مالی تاکید کرد.

نظرات خوشبینانه رمجی در مورد بلاک چین پس از راه اندازی یک ETF توسط Blackrock صورت گرفت که سبدی متشکل از ۴۱ شرکت مرتبط با بلاک چین را ردیابی می‌کند. Coinbase، بزرگترین صرافی ارزهای دیجیتال در ایالات متحده، بیشترین سهم از دارایی های این محصول را تشکیل می‌دهد.

با این حال، BlackRock هنوز به خود کریپتو اطمینان ندارد. رمجی به این رسانه گفت با وجود این واقعیت که شرکت های مالی بزرگ مانند Fidelity برنامه های ETF خود را ارائه کرده‌اند، اما این شرکت هنوز قصد ندارد محصول بیت کوین خود را عرضه کند. او توضیح می دهد که BlackRock باید از نظر کیفیت و تطابق با مقررات، انتظارات را برآورده کند.

با این حال، به گفته رمجی، BlackRock ظاهراً در را برای راه اندازی یک محصول بیت کوین در آینده باز می‌گذارد. این غول مالی مستقر در نیویورک تمایلی به تعقیب روندهای بازار ندارد. در بلندمدت، این شرکت می‌تواند دسترسی به رمزارزها را هم تراز دارایی‌ های مالی سنتی مانند طلا افزایش دهد.

در ماه آوریل (فرور**دین)، BlackRock با ناشر USD Coin یعنی Circle همکاری کرد که شامل برنامه های کاربردی بازار سرمایه برای دومین استیبل کوین بزرگ است.** رمجی ادعا می‌کند که این همکاری موفقیت آمیز بوده است.

## Some Key Usecases:
* **Payment.** By establishing a distributed ledger, Blockchain provides faster payment with lower cost in comparison to current banking systems. Cross-border
payment is usually complicated, time-consuming and costing 5 − 20% remitted
amount, while Blockchain is believed to cut down the fee to 2 − 3%.
BitPesa is a B2B payment Blockchain-based company operating in Kenya,
Nigeria and Uganda, gained over 25,000 customers after 5 years, processed
more than 1 million transactions worth of 340 million dollars. BitPay is another Blockchain-based payment company in the US, funded 72 million USD,
accepting bitcoin payment.

* **Clearing and settlement.** Ripple, a Blockchain startup specializing in bank
settlement, estimates that it could cut 33% fee compared to SWIFT. Ripple has
more than 100 customers. **Stellar** collaborates with IBM to develop a Blockchainbased international payment for 44 banks in over 72 countries with 47 currencies. **MoneyGram is one the biggest Stellar's partners.
It only takes a few seconds to complete a transaction on its Blockchain. CordaR3, a distributed ledger platform for bank settlement, aims to become a new
operating system for the financial market. It has raised 107 million dollars from
Bank of America, Meryll Lynch and HSBC in 2017.

* **Identity verification.** This crucial process normally requires many steps and
takes long time, multiple duplicated among financial institutions and companies.
Blockchain helps create a decentralized, easily accessible, fast verifiable and secure database of digital identities with privacy. Cambridge Blockchain and Tradle
are fintech startups which utilize Blockchain to enhance various procedures in
banks with the help of a customer verification system.

* **Security token offering and digital asset exchange.** In 2015, Nasdaq
planned to use Blockchain for their private market platform, with the introduction of Colored Coin concept, to distinguish coins used in transactions with
other types. Nasdaq joined Citigroup to invest in Chain, a Blockchain company
which provides a reliable decentralized database that records all stock and ownership transactions in real time. Putting stock on Blockchain could save 17 to
24 billion dollars annually for global processing fee.

* **Credit and syndicated loan.** By eliminating the **gatekeeper** in lending and
credit, Blockchain can reduce risk. In 2016, Credit Suisse, Symbiont, R3 and
Ipreo completed the first stage of a project using Blockchain in syndicated loan
market. In April 2018, international banks, BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon, HSBC,
ING, Natixis and State Street, jointly supported Fusion LenderComm by Finastra, a Blockchain platform for syndicated loan. BBVA, Mitsubishi UFJ and
BNP Paribas gave a 150 million dollars of syndicated loan to Red Electrica, a
Spanish electronic company. The event was recorded on **Ethereum.**

* **Trade finance.** By simplifying procedures, Blockchain can strengthen transparency, security and trust among partners on the globe. TradeLens (Maersk
and IBM joint venture) and eTradeConnect (formed by Hong Kong banks) are
notable distributed platforms for trade finance. Voltron (under R3 and CryptoBLK) operates Blockchain-based platform for letter of credit application.
**The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** is looking to develop a **proof-of-concept blockchain** project focused on **trade financing**, alongside multiple top Indian banks, HDFC Bank (HDFCBANK), ICICI Bank (ICICIBANK) and State Bank of India (SBIN) are among those participating in the project designed to tackle **loan fraud**. IBM (IBM), **Corda** Technologies and Belgium-based **SettleMint** are providing technological support for the project.

* **Crowdfunding.** Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is a new way for tech startups
to approach funding. In the first half of 2018, ICOs raised 13.7 billions dollars,
doubled from 7 billion in 2017, according to Businessinsider.

* **Accounting and Audit.** Distributed technology can help remove lots of paperwork involved in this field. Blockchain can become as a decentralized notary.
Furthermore, smart contracts are useful for automatic invoicing. PricewaterhouseCoopers has developed Blockchain-based accounting service for enterprises.

## Sketching a network architecture
The network can function a decentralized cloud banking infrastructure as a service, running on the top of existing core-banking systems. Then all banking and financial services can be implemented as decentralized applications, running on the top of the cloud (i.e. the Blockchain), which utilize all advantages of Blockchain and smartcontract, while preserving the essential legal compliance and security of the banking systems.

## Two-tier network and workflow
The proposed network is not pure peer-to-peer like Bitcoin, Ethereum and other public Blockchains. It consists of two classes (or tiers): **master nodes** and **normal nodes** (see Fig. 1) with different right and role.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nurafintech/whitepapers/main/Banking/Blockchain%20banking%20cloud.png)

* **Master nodes** are block generators who hold the ultimate power, be able to
function all core protocols and the consensus mechanism, and store full blockdata. **Only legitimate banks can become master nodes**. The block generators verify submitted transactions, then gather in a block and finalize it according to the consensus mechanism.
* Normal nodes are transaction validators. **Banks, financial institutions, payment service providers, big merchants**, can join the network as normal nodes. The validators receive transaction proposals from clients (i.e. from end-users), validate them and then forward to master nodes for confirmation and finalization.

In general, clients may submit their transaction proposals directly to master nodes. However, master nodes give priority to the validated transaction pool. Normal nodes help validate transactions before sending to master nodes, thus reduce the block generators’ workload.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nurafintech/whitepapers/main/Banking/Blockchain%20banking%20cloud%20flowchart.png)

 The network allows nodes attaching their private chains (or private payment channels) on the main chain, thus improving the overall scalability and performance.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nurafintech/whitepapers/main/Banking/Block%20data%20and%20participants.png)

* The Header
  1. Hash of previous block (i.e. hashing value of the previous block data).
  2. Time stamp presents the time point of block generation.
  3. Root hash of the Merkle tree.
* The State
  1. New registered identification hashes (e.g. hashing values of [name, identity number, birthday]).
  2. New registered account addresses ( e.g. hashing [bank code] + hashing [public key] ).
  3. Balance and state updates show new state changes on the entire network, ( e.g. [identity-account mapping, account addresses, available balance, other new states] ).
  4. Coinbase presents rewards (paid via a native token like bitcoin, ether). Feebase describes stable-coin-based transaction fee. Rewards and fees are accompanied with an appropriate distribution over the nodes.
* The Body
  1. Clearing updates show clearing statistics among participant banks (commonly master nodes only) so they can proceed to settlement, e.g. via an outside clearing house.
  2. Transaction records show detail information of all transactions and their hash values, e.g. [sender’s addresses, receiver’s addresses, number of transferred tokens].

The proposed block data and its distribution differ with existing public Blockchains in the following major points:
* **Account** and **identity:** Identification hash is mapped with a real identity stored off chain. An identification hash may be attached with (at least) one or many account addresses. Every account must be mapped with at least one identity.
* **Coinbase** and **feebase** presents a dual-token model. The coinbase utilizes a native toke (like bitcoin, ether) to incentivize participating nodes for contribution to the network operation. The feebase uses stable coins (i.e. digitized fiat currencies based on bank pledge) as transaction fee utilities, except native coin transactions.
* **Clearing update** gives clearing statistics among participant banks so they can proceed to settlement, especially in real time without a centralized clearing house, provided a builtin central bank digital currency.

Master nodes play the critical role of full block data storage and full operation on
the network. When a block is produced and endorsed, the generator will broadcast it fully to other master nodes, the header and the state to normal nodes. The
normal nodes can use the header and the body for Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) and transaction validation without asking master nodes. SPV nodes
on Bitcoin Network must ask full nodes to verify certain transactions. Thus, normal nodes in our network are neither precisely equivalent to Simplified Payment
Verification nodes nor full nodes on Bitcoin or Ethereum. In addition, block data
(specified relevant transaction info) is partially updated to the associated users.
This task is normally done by normal nodes and client servers.

#

## Core protocols

**Identification protocol** utilizes hash (checksum) techniques to help identity
verification better and faster. The Blockchain network does not store customer
identity information but its hashed value for cross verification. Member banks
and other network participants keep their own customer identity information in
their own private database. The only thing the members do is registering (i.e.
submitting) identity hash values on the network. Note that each identity hash
is identical with one and only one body (e.g. an individual, a company or an
organization):
1. An user request opening an account on the cloud banking network. The
node storing his identity info will hash the data, then broadcast the hashed
value associated with (at least) one or many new public addresses to the
network. The registration is complete once the identity hash and its associated address(es) are included in a confirmed block. Then the user can make
transactions.
2. If no identity information exists, then the user is required to complete Know
Your Customer (KYC) process. After KYC, it returns Step 1.

The identification hash helps the network’s participants verify the existence of
an identity while keeping the original identity information confidentially outside the Blockchain. This protects privacy and confidentiality while facilitating cross verification, certification and information exchange. **Note that all public Blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum) store anonymous addresses without any mapping to real identities. Our proposed Blockchain is anonymous on chain but every account is associated with a verified KYC info stored off-chain (at least in some node’s private database).**

بنابراین بحث KYC به صورت Centralized بوده و اطلاعات هویتی افراد باید در جایی ذخیره بشوند.

**Incentive protocol** is **implemented** at the **bottom of the Blockchain**, and only **master nodes** (as block generators) have the right to function and maintain it. The protocol issues a unique native token (or native coin) utilized for staking (in the consensus mechanism) and rewarding on the entire Blockchain network. The native coin represents the **intrinsic value of the Blockchain cloud banking network analogously to crypto assets** (e.g. BTC of Bitcoin, ETH of Ethereum), which may varies over time. Therefore, no stable coin (e.g. digitized fiat types) can satisfy that special nature. The protocol will pre-mine a certain amount of native coins at the genesis block (i.e. block 0) to use for initial staking of the foundation nodes. After that the new coins are generated as reward per newly produced block and distributed appropriately to all nodes, and possibly to the development foundation.

For example, the parameters of the incentive protocol can be set as followed:
* The block reward rate is max 2% of the current supply per year, evenly divided per block. One can set a maximal supply (e.g. 1 billion native coins), i.e. the protocol will not generate new coins any more after reaching that number.
*  In each block, coinbase protocol computes and distributes new generated coins and transaction fees (applied for native coin transactions and specified executions only) as the following. Assuming there is N nodes on the Blockchain network:

    • 10% or 1/N (for which smaller) to the block generator.

    • 5% or 1/2N (for which smaller) to the block endorsers who co-sign to finalize the block (if any), other than the generator.
    
    • 10% or 1/N (for which smaller) to the transaction validators (evenly divided by the number of native coin transactions included in the block).

    • 3% or 1/3N (for which smaller) to the development foundation.

    • The rest 72% will be distributed evenly as 44% to all master nodes and 28% to all normal nodes.


**Stable coin protocol** (more explicitly the fiat digitization protocol) is implemented at the bottom of the Blockchain, i.e. only master nodes have the
right to operate and maintain it. The protocol allows issuing digital tokens 1-
to-1 corresponding to equivalent cash pledged in bank and burning the tokens
corresponding to cash withdrawal amount. This means no new currency is issued. The token is simply an accounting representative of cash reserve in bank.
The protocol also provides digitized fiat balance update of all accounts on the
network. Zero Knowledge Proof algorithms can be implemented to blind user
balance updates (in the state of block data) sending to normal nodes. **An implementation of shielded transactions and addresses can be found on Tron using zk-SNARK**. The purpose is protecting privacy on the entire network while
allowing easy verification and fully tracking on the master nodes and the account
holders respectively:

* Cashin allows users (with registered account on the network) deposit to the Blockchain network based on their cash balance in bank. For example, an user requests a deposit of $1000, his home bank verifies and confirms if his cash balance is enough. Then the bank (also a master node) issues $1000 stable coins to the user’s Blockchain account.
* Cashout allows users withdraw cash from his own balance on the Blockchain. For example, an user requests a withdrawal of $1000, any member can verifies his balance and confirms cash providing. Then $1000 stable coins are deducted from the user account and sent to the burning address (containing exactly non-reusable redeemed stable coins).
* Cashin must be executed by associated banks while cashout can be provided
by any member of the network.
*  Fee for Cashin and Cashout is cash basis and depends on the service providers.

In addition, the stable coin protocol allows nodes to setup their desire fee for
transaction validation and confirmation, except native coin transactions. The
protocol also returns feebase to be included in the state of block data (Fig. 3).
In addition, the protocol allows **multiple stable coin issuance**. Each type of stable
coins can be easily **converted** to others via **atomic swap techniques** which has
many practiced implementations in crypto-currency space.



**Clearing protocol** is implemented at the bottom of the Blockchain, and only
master nodes have the right to operate it. Per block, the protocol reads:

 #per participant bank, run

    Cash_flow = Cashin - Cashout

#then for the entire network, return

    Clear(positive Cash_flow group, negative Cash_flow group)

## Governance on the network

Our proposed Blockchain is **neither permissionless nor permissioned**. In fact,
no central authority exists on the network. Then a nomination mechanism is
introduced to ensure that only qualified candidates have opportunity to join the
group of network operators while preventing corruption caused by one centralized
authority and potential malicious guys.

###  The conditions to become a node
**The necessary condition.** To become an operating node, a candidate must
stake a required minimum amount of native coins to activate (or register) the
pair of public-private keys with the network. A higher minimum stake is required
for master node role.

**The sufficient condition.** A body wishing to become a network operator (i.e.
a master or normal node) must complete registration first, and then nomination.
Explicitly, a candidate for normal node is required at least two nominations from
normal nodes or one nomination from master nodes. A candidate for master node
is required at least two master node nominators. One may ask an additional
condition that the two nominators must possess (in summation) a minimum
percentage (e.g. 10% or 2/N for which smaller) of the total reputation scores of
all nodes, where N is the number of nodes.
 Of course, at the genesis block, no nomination happens, and the foundation nodes
are all promoted up by the developer legitimately. Note that, if the developer is
not a legal licensed bank, it may not be a master node, because other foundation
banks do not allow to build up such a network.

**Node deactivation.** An active node can decide itself to leave the network, simply inform its leaving with other nodes. Another way, operating nodes can vote
to kick out some node if it is not honest with proven damage evidences for the
network, or it is not qualified longer under the assessment of the majority. Votes
are weighted by reputation scores and at least 68% of weighted
majority from the network is needed to deactivate a node. This mechanism helps
removing proven malicious nodes from the network and promoting high quality
nomination, honest commitment and frequent activities.

###  Reputation score system
Reputation is very important in social reality. It bases on two major factors:
wealth and performance (or achievement). Thuat Do et. al. investigated reputation in Blockchain space and introduced a novel framework for consensus, namely **Delegated Proof of Reputation.**
Therein, ranking (inspired by Google’s
PageRanking) is an essential component contributing to reputation, **applied not only for nodes but also all accounts** on the network.
It exploits the idea that a
node’s ranking is built up over time based on its cooperation (connection) and
work achievement. Basically, more valuable transactions, more connection will
get higher ranking.

در این گزارش به چگونگی پیاده سازی و استفاده از الگوریتم های ranking برای تعیین و تغییر اعتبار و شهرت، نمیپردازیم و صرفا فرض میکنیم که چنین سیستم های ranking ای، برای امنیت و پایداری کلی سیستم چقدر خوب میباشند.

### Block production and consensus mechanism
A bundle of consensus protocols are proposed and implemented in various Blockchain
networks. The most popular ones (by order) are Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). In this part, the author exploits **Delegated Proof of Reputation (DPoR)**, with a modification (i.e. removing resource power in overall reputation Accounts on the network are allowed to grant their reputation scores to operating nodes (**this is similar to voting procedure in Tron and EOS**). A node’s reputation score (included granted quantities) is converted to the probability of the node to be selected as transaction validators, block generators, reputation score providers and random source generators. Higher reputation score implies greater probability and hence earning more rewards and fees.

he Algorand Blockchain uses a Byzantine Agreement protocol and verifiable random function in its so-called pure PoS consensus system. Such a random function is a usefully practical implementation to deploy on other PoS-based Blockchains, as random sources play a critical role in the selection of block generators and transaction validators fairly and honestly.
