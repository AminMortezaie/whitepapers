# Brief history of VeChain
VeChain was founded in 2015 by  electrical engineer sunny lou. VeChain  was created by vechain tech, a software  company based in china. Moreover  the development is coordinated by  the VeChain foundation, a non-profit  based in singapore.VeChain raised 20 million dollars in a  2017 ico and its main net went live in the summer of 2018.


# VeChain's blockchain is called VeChainThor
VeChain's blockchain is called VeChainThor and it's actually a modified fork of ethereum's blockchain that's been  optimized for supply chain solutions  in contrast to ethereum vechain doesn't  use proof of work or proof of stake  instead it uses a consensus algorithm called proof of authority whose creation  is credited to ethereum co-founder and  polkadot founder gavin wood.

# What's VeChain?
VeChain’s vision of lowering the barrier and enabling established business with blockchain technology to create value and solve real world economic problems has been clear to us from the very beginning.<br/>

To achieve and fully harness this technology that will enable mass public adoption, we have identified the three major phases of blockchain evolvement – Technical Consensus, Business Consensus, and Governance Consensus. These phases will be the foundation and strategy to enable the VeChainThor blockchain to be adopted as the world’s premier choice of blockchain.<br/>

#  PoA
The Proof-of-Authority consensus is a consensus algorithm that demands nodes to be authorized in order to participate in the blockchain consensus. Once authorized, nodes are given equal chances to publish new blocks and gain rewards. As a result, there is no need for nodes to spend vast amount of resources to compete with each other. In addition, richer nodes do not have more advantages than other nodes in the system.</br>

Proof of Authority aims to make more transactions by using some previous authorities which is great but it's permissioned, furthermore it could provide high performance and fault tolerance.To gain this authority and a right to generate new blocks, a node must pass a preliminary authentication.

# Advantages of PoA consensus

<li>High-performance hardware is not required. Compared to PoW consensus, PoA consensus does not require nodes to spend computational resources for solving complex mathematical tasks.</li>
<li>The interval of time at which new blocks are generated is predictable. For PoW and PoS consensuses, this time varies.</li>
<li>High transaction rate. Blocks are generated in a sequence at appointed time interval by authorized network nodes. This increases the speed at which transactions are validated.</li>

# 51% Attack in PoA
In PoA consensus, the 51% attack requires an attacker to obtain control over 51% of network nodes. This is different from the 51% attack for the Proof-of-Work consensus types where an attacker needs to obtain 51% of network computational power. Obtaining control of the nodes in a permissioned blockchain network is much harder than obtaining computational power.
