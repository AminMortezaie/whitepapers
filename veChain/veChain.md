# Brief history of VeChain
VeChain was founded in 2015 by electrical engineer Sunny Lu. VeChain  was created by vechain tech, a software  company based in china. Moreover  the development is coordinated by  the VeChain foundation, a non-profit  based in singapore.VeChain raised 20 million dollars in a  2017 ico and its main net went live in the summer of 2018.


# VeChain's blockchain is called VeChainThor
VeChain's blockchain is called VeChainThor and it's actually a modified fork of ethereum's blockchain that's been  optimized for supply chain solutions  in contrast to ethereum vechain doesn't  use proof of work or proof of stake  instead it uses a consensus algorithm called proof of authority whose creation  is credited to ethereum co-founder and polkadot founder gavin wood.



# What's VeChain?
VeChain’s vision of lowering the barrier and enabling established business with blockchain technology to create value and solve real world economic problems has been clear to us from the very beginning.<br/>

To achieve and fully harness this technology that will enable mass public adoption, we have identified the three major phases of blockchain evolvement – Technical Consensus, Business Consensus, and Governance Consensus. These phases will be the foundation and strategy to enable the VeChainThor blockchain to be adopted as the world’s premier choice of blockchain.<br/>

#  PoA
The Proof-of-Authority consensus is a consensus algorithm that demands nodes to be authorized in order to participate in the blockchain consensus. Once authorized, nodes are given equal chances to publish new blocks and gain rewards. As a result, there is no need for nodes to spend vast amount of resources to compete with each other. In addition, richer nodes do not have more advantages than other nodes in the system.</br>

Proof of Authority aims to make more transactions by using some previous authorities which is great but it's permissioned, furthermore it could provide high performance and fault tolerance.To gain this authority and a right to generate new blocks, a node must pass a preliminary authentication.<br/>
**PoA chooses which network participant produces a block based on reputation.**


# Advantages of PoA consensus

<li>High-performance hardware is not required. Compared to PoW consensus, PoA consensus does not require nodes to spend computational resources for solving complex mathematical tasks.</li>
<li>The interval of time at which new blocks are generated is predictable. For PoW and PoS consensuses, this time varies.</li>
<li>High transaction rate. Blocks are generated in a sequence at appointed time interval by authorized network nodes. This increases the speed at which transactions are validated.</li>

# 51% Attack in PoA
In PoA consensus, the 51% attack requires an attacker to obtain control over 51% of network nodes. This is different from the 51% attack for the Proof-of-Work consensus types where an attacker needs to obtain 51% of network computational power. Obtaining control of the nodes in a permissioned blockchain network is much harder than obtaining computational power.


# VeChain Authority Nodes
VeChain currently has 101 authority  nodes which process all transactions on its blockchain, and any prospective authority nodes must apply with and be approved by the vechain foundation. Furthermore, authority nodes must take a  minimum of 25 million vet which is used for staking and governance.

# VeChain Maximum Supply
VET has a maximum supply of 86.7 billion all of which has technically vested, in exchange for staking VET and  processing transactions authority nodes earn VTho which is used to pay for  transaction fees on VeChain(up until today there are about 67 billion tokens are circulating).

# VTho has no maximum supply
VTho has no maximum supply.
Its inflation schedule is periodically adjusted by the VeChain foundation with the consent of  stakeholders and **70% of any VTho used to  pay for transaction fees is burned.**

# VeChain isn't too centralized but it's quite centralized
To ensure that VeChain isn't too  centralized, most of the voting power for any changes to VeChain are held by  economic nodes(EN) and Xnodes(XN) which do not  process transactions but can also earn VTho for staking VET.

![](https://github.com/AminMortezaie/whitepapers/blob/main/veChain/Stakeholder%20category%20and%20the%20voting%20authority%20model1.PNG?raw=true)
<br/>
This quite centralized setup would allow VeChain to process around 10,000 transactions per second which is not too shabby and also it should be mentioned that this impressive statistic doesn't apply to smart contract transactions since VeChain leverages the EVM which tps is capped at around 300. 

# VeChain thrive on making more decentralized 
To ensure that the VeChainThor blockchain doesn't get too bloated all decentralized applications and tokens are approved by VET holders and the VeChain foundation.


# What is PoA 2.0?
The new consensus algorithm PoA 2.0-SURFACE, is characterized as a Secure, Use-case adaptive, and Relatively Fork-free Approach of Chain Extension.The mechanism is the first in the world to combine the strengths of the two main consensus types, Byzantine Fault Tolerance and Nakamoto Consensus while eliminating the weaknesses of each.<br/>

PoA enables our vision of building green technologies and business on a scale never before witnessed on blockchain. Global, next generation markets will come to rely on the trustless and automated nature afforded by public blockchain. For example, carbon markets arising from the drive towards decarbonisation require these traits to enable trustless international collaboration. We foresee many novel and revolutionary applications and look forward to sharing our future works in these exciting new areas.

It consisted of three major  components. Firstly, it introduced verifiable  randomness as part of the process to  select which authority node produces a  block, secondly it modified the block producing  process to make it next to impossible for VeChainThor to fork, and thirdly it sped up block finality on  VeChainThor which apparently increased its transactions per second.

# VeChain Foundation Movements
<li>
The VeChain foundation launched a one million grant program to encourage the adoption of VeChain enterprise nfts or enfts. 
<br/></li>

<li>
VeChain partnered with a chinese  hospital to track the process of in  vitro fertilizations.
<br/></li>

<li>
VeChain partnered with the republic of san marino for a similarly spooky purpose and that was for a blockchain-based pandemic health  passport using VeChain's enfts  interestingly. 
Sunny Lu explained in a  presentation that VeChain's pandemic health passports actually offer way more privacy than the ones being pushed by european governments which he claims are  violating european data protection laws.
<br/></li>

<li>
VeChain released a tool to  help Chinese companies track their  carbon emissions in accordance with China's goal to become carbon neutral by  2060.
<br/></li>

<li>
A Chinese arm of  price water house coopers revealed a tool  called airtrace which uses VeChainThor to track air quality in chinese cities.
<br/></li>

<li>
VeChain partnered with the  government of inner mongolia to track  and trace agricultural products.
<br/></li>

<li>
VeChain launched  the VeUSD stablecoin in conjunction with  a regulated fintech startup based in the  united states called Stably.VeUSD is  a centralized stablecoin like circles USDC or paxos's USDP meaning every VeUSD  in circulation is backed by US dollars  sitting in a bank associated with Stably.
<br/></li>

<li>
The VeChain foundation set up a new headquarters in the republic of  san marino and will work with the  government there to achieve its mission  of making san marino the first carbon  neutral country.
<br/></li>

<li>
VeChain revealed an upcoming platform called VeCarbon which will make it possible to track both individual and institutional carbon emissions and will eventually allow for carbon emissions and trading.
<br/></li>

<li>
VeChain foundation  billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper also partnered with VeChain to  launch the web3 accelerator program in association with draper university Tim's educational enterprise.
<br/></li>


# Hard Time For VET Price Reasons
<li>
BTC is still recovering from its november crash and as VET is highly correlated to BTC. 
<br/></li>
<li>
The may crash was caused by China's  crackdown on crypto mining and China's clampdown on the industry has only accelerated since then this is bad news for VeChain because china is where the project has secured most of its partnerships and it's also where the software company behind VeChain is based thought VeChain seems to be expanding its presence outside of  China. The VeChain foundation's new european headquarters and the VeUSD stablecoin supports this idea.
<br/></li>

<li>
VeChain's adoption doesn't exactly translate to increased  demand for VET because it's only used for staking and governance of these two fundamental demand drivers. Staking is probably the most dominant and the bad news there is that the minimum stake to become an economic node(EN) or Xnode(XN) that earns a meaningful amount  of VTho isn't all that affordable for the average person.
<br/></li>
